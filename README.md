# STuPiDSoRT
A collection of the worst possible algorithms for just about everything

## Why?
Because.

## No, really. Why?
I had some time to kill and no super interesting projects to work on, so I decided to get stupid.

## Can I use these?
Honestly? No. Please don't. They'll haunt you for the rest of your life, destroy your sanity and reputation, and quite possibly start a fire wherever they're used.

In all seriousness, whatever you do, please don't use these in production. I don't want my life to be in the hands of these algorithms as I hop into the self-driving car of the future.

## I wanna add my stupidity to the mix!
Feel free to open up a pull request! If nothing else, you could try implementing these algorithms in your favorite language.
